        <p>Hot and sour soup is such a popular dish takeout dish, along with <a href="https://omnivorescookbook.com/chinese-egg-drop-soup/" target="_blank">egg drop soup</a> 
            and 
            <a href="https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/wonton-soup" target="_blank">wonton soup</a>. It’s one of those things that we almost always order when eating in a restaurant. The soup is loaded with so many goodies that I totally wouldn’t mind serving it as a main dish for a light dinner.</p>

    <h2> The soup base
    </h2>

    <div>
        <p>Did you know that hot and sour soup is actually super easy to make?
    
        </p>
        <p>Yes, the recipe below might look a bit long, because I wanted to create a proper restaurant-style hot and sour soup for you. But in fact, the soup base requires only a few ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>Chinkiang vinegar
                </li>
                <li>White pepper powder
                </li>
                <li>Water mixed with cornstarch (to thicken the soup)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
        <p>That’s it!
    
        </p>
        <p>The sourness of the soup comes from the Chinkiang vinegar. And the spiciness comes from the white pepper powder. No peppers or chili oil required!</p>

    <h2> A word about the dried ingredients
    </h2>

    <div>
        <p>
            My recipe uses some dried ingredients that might require a trip to an Asian market or a purchase on Amazon. But if you don’t want to make the extra effort, you can totally skip these ingredients. I will explain why.
        </p>

        <p>I previously discussed how to use Chinese dried veggies to create a superior flavor in another recipe – <a href="https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/buddhas-delight" target="_blank">Buddha’s Delight</a>, a Jai (Buddhist vegetarian) dish. The logic is the same here. The foundation of the broth consists of <a href="https://omnivorescookbook.com/pantry/dried-lily-flowers" target="_blank">dried lily flowers</a> and <a href="https://omnivorescookbook.com/pantry/dried-shiitake-mushroom" target="_blank">dried shiitake mushrooms</a>. They both have a very concentrated smoky, earthy, and woody aroma. Once you rehydrate them, the rehydrating water will turn a dark brown color as it becomes infused with the great flavor. Do not throw this water away. It is the best vegan broth and you should use it to make the soup base.
        </p>

        <p>The other dry ingredient is <a href="https://omnivorescookbook.com/pantry/wood-ear/" target="_blank">wood ear mushrooms</a>. It is a mildly flavored fungus that adds a crunchy texture to the dish.</p>
        <p><img src="../img/1805_Hot-And-Sour-Soup_005.jpg" alt="Hot and sour soup dried ingredients - shiitake mushrooms, lily flowers, wood ear mushroom" title="Hot and Sour Soup (酸辣汤) - Authentic Chinese restaurant-style hot and sour soup made easy."></p>

        <p>Chinese families always have these ingredients on hand because they allow a cheaper and healthier way to create a flavorful broth. If you use these ingredients, your soup will turn out more like the Chinese restaurant version.</p>
        <p>However, if you do not have these ingredients, simply skip them and use chicken stock or vegetable stock instead of water to make your soup.</p>
